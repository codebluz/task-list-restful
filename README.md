## ðŸš€ Technologies and dependencies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- NodeJs
- MongoDB

And it has the following dependencies:

- express
- colors
- JWT
- Bcrypt
- Mongoose
- Sucrase
- yup

## ðŸ’» Project

This API connects with Mongodb for creating users and creating and handling tasks, ready to be consumed by the frontend.

## ðŸ’» Structure

- To create a user, it is necessary to inform name, email and password with at least 6 characters.
- The creation of tasks receives the false status automatically during creation, for now it is only possible to manipulate the status.

Comments:
- The project is still under development and soon the Tasks will be more robust.
- Soon I will release the collection to consume the API.
